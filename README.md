# 3nrgy_bot
My Discord Bot:

This is my Discord bot called 3nrgy. He's quite *energetic*, as you can tell by the name. He can do things like tell the time, greet you,
tell you his ping, tell you the date and so on. He's basically a multi-purpose bot, essential for all servers, no matter the size.

I wrote this bot in Python and am using Heroku to deploy it.
Contents:
  1. '3nrgy_bot.py' is the Py code for the actual bot.
  2.  'Procfile' declares what worker type you want.
  3. 'a' is for some old, local logs
  4.  'README.md' is what you're reading right now! (notes)
  5.  'Requirements.txt' tells Heroku what what libraries it needs to download to be able to run my bot.

Thanks for reading!
